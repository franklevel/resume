Being a member of Tiarg team, I contributed to three different projects.

**Galileo Project** - National Ministry of Modernization
There I was working using AngularJS and Zend framework, I was working on creating new features, and fixing bugs among others. I worked there for six months until returning to Tiarg headquarters. Once there, I start to create from scratch a new medical appointment system. It would be developed using React, Koa, and PostgreSQL. I was assigned to work on the front-end side and I was creating all the basic features for a month. Then I was moved to a new client ARSAT. There I was working with Drupal and my work consisted of creating a new theme to be implemented in the new site release.Being a member of Tiarg team, I contributed to three different projects.

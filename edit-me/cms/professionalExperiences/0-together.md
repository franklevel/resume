title: Volunteer Position

The goal of this volunteer program is to help others to overcome all technical and non-technical difficulties in the workplace through pressure release sessions as well as to share experiences that allow to address the issues in an efficient way.

These are not coaching sessions, they are just friendly reminders that we always have someone willing to listen and help us.

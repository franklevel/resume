At BI, I was able to accomplish my first goal of working for a company that enforces me to interact in English only.
I was part of the HubNext team. HubNext is a Drupal flavor designed to be deployed easily including custom modules, themes, and configurations that all the BI partners need to have.

Working there I developed a module from scratch called Vet Locator. This module allowed to perform a search by entering a key, zip code, and so on, and then it rendered all the veterinary shops or clinics within a geographic radius.
It was developed using Node as a backend service, Laravel as SDK, and Symfony (drupal module).
During this process, I was assisted by the WebPro team and I did a successful demonstration meeting for the beta version.
Then I continued working on creating new features, fixing defects, and doing code reviews as usual on HubNext project.At BI, I was able to accomplish my first goal of working for a company that enforces me to interact in English only.

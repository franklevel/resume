When I was part of Goiar I was able to learn and contribute to the team working on three projects:
Microsoft Landing Pages:
Design and develop landing pages using HTML, Javascript, Gulp, and SASS. In this project, I enhanced several landing pages with awesome results.
POSSIBLE General Manager
POSSIBLE is a US agency that asked us to fix several defects on their internal manager software, we were contacted to work on those fixes. That software was built using Symfony and VueJS. I was working on that for almost a month fixing several errors that they reported and others that I found by myself. Then they wanted to create a new General Manager from scratch, this development was assigned to me and I was able to work on that only in the first phase since I had to move to the next project.
Intel Marketing Studio
I was working on this project from the beginning, I had the opportunity to contribute to that by being part of the backend and solution team. we developed this platform using a microservices architecture, so we created eight microservices (gateway, user, campaign, resources, assets, mail, metrics, logs) All those were developed using Lumen (PHP) and were deployed into AWS.
Besides this, I also developed an authentication resource to allow frontend developers to get a JWT since Intel native method is currently a production one, and they don't have a sandbox to allow to mock this process. This development was achieved using NodeJS.When I was part of Goiar I was able to learn and contribute to the team working on three projects: Microsoft Landing Pages: Design and develop landing pages using HTML, Javascript, Gulp, and SASS.

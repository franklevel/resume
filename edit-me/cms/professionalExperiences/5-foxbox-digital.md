At Foxbox Digital I've contributed to three different projects:
Sydney Health (Mobile Telehealth)
This mobile application was developed for Anthem and we were working on the frontend side using React Native. During this time I was able to contribute by creating several features, and fixing bugs among others. I also was part of code reviewers on the backend side promoted by the Anthem team.
Hoddie (Cannabis Industry Analytics PWA)
Hoddie is a web platform that provides analytics for the cannabis industry, my participation in this project was as a backend engineer. I had the opportunity to work on awesome features, technologies, and services such as AWS Lambda, Typescript, GraphQL, Hasura, and Elastic.
Capitalize On Yourself Company (Content Creator Platform - SaaS)
CoyCO as we call it, it's a platform that allows connecting content creators with their audience. It's built using NextJS, Typescript, Node, AWS Lambda, AWS Cognito, AWS Aurora, and AWS S3 for storing all the media files.
I've been contributing to this project since March 2022 as a backend engineer where I've been working on developing new features, fixing defects, doing code reviews,s and also contributing to its documentation.At Foxbox Digital I've contributed to three different projects: Sydney Health (Mobile Telehealth) This mobile application was developed for Anthem and we were working on the frontend side using React Native.

Chazki-VTEX middleware
I built a middleman application which consisted of allowing VTEX sellers to connect their stores and receive all the placed orders to be sent through a private API to a logistics company called Chazki. This integration software was developed using React, Express, NodeJS, MongoDB, and Docker. It was deployed into Vultr instance and it was powered by PM2.
It was developed in two phases, the first phase consisted of integrating the logistic Chazki API for Argentina and Chile, and the second one was integrating the existing ones for Mexico and Peru.
Other technologies that I used there were:
Pusher to send and receive push notifications in real-time.
Redux to handle the application state.
Formiik to build and handle all the forms.
JWT to authenticate users.
ChartJS to create insights into the dashboards.
Chazki-Tiendanube middleware
I developed a Node backend to connect Tiendanube sellers with Chazki through their API's. I created this software using Handlebars as a template engine and Node with Javascript. The database engine was MySQL.
It was deployed to Vultr and monitored using PM2.Chazki-VTEX middleware Chazki is a last-mile logistics company. VTEX is an enterprise digital commerce platform.
